# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
#If you used the command, "cd ~", it would take you back to the original, home directory or in the context of this problem, to Desktop.

# 2) What does ~/ mean?
# I believe this just refers to the home directory/folder.

# 3) What's the difference between and abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
# An absolute path is the complete, unambiguous route to a file or directory from the system root.
# The relative path is the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory.

# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
#If you use the command, "cd ~", it will take you back to your home directory. I also found that just inputting the command "cd" alone works in the same way.

# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do? 
#The rm command is used to remove objects from a working directory, like files, directories, etc. 

# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
# Git add can stage spcific files from the working directory, git commit serves to commit the changes to the local repository (your computer) with a message, and git push serves to push the changes to Github (a remote repository).

# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
#If you call git add and then git status, you would see a note showing you that github is tracking the staged changes, and that they are ready to be committed. They are not a par tof the repository yet, until you run git commit.

# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
#The most frustrating bug/error I found was actually trying to push files onto github, which was resolved with switching "git push origin main" to "git push origin master"

# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
#If you clone a repository, it serves as kind of making a copy of someone else's google doc, you get your own copy that will no longer be changes if the original owner decides to make any changes, and you can choose to change it as well.
#If you pull a repository, it is kind of like if the owner of a google doc shared it ith you. You wuld still get the updates that the owner makes with the repository in real time, and you may be allowed to collaborate.
#Moreover, git cone is used to create a local copy of a repository for the first time, and git pull is used to sort of sync uodates from a remote repository to yiur local repository, or the existing local copy.

# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
# I have a twin brother, and I once had over 36 pets at once.
